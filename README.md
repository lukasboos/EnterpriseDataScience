This is a university project to make some data science on the actual situation of covid-19.

First i created a static visualization of the Covid cases for 3 countries in each figure:
        Delivery 1 : Figure 1 The relative cases overtime of Covid infectors (absolut Covid cases/population size)
        Delivery 2 : Figure 2 The vaccination rate (percentage of the population) over time
        
In the second part i created two Dashboards for all countries which is in the Johns Hopkins dataset on Github:
        Delivery 3: I developed the Covid-19 dashboard prototype which shows the infected population over time, the doubling rate and the values filtered           by using a Savgol filter. The country can be selected.
        Delivery 4: I implemented the SIR virus spread model in a dynamic dashboard (DASH implementation). Each country can be selected. The real curve and         the fitted curve is presented.
